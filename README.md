# Hospital-Management-System
The Java Application to manage Hospital Staff and Patients
In this Project I use Core Java and Java Library with Classes and Objects. I created three classes i.e MainClass, Patient Class & Doctor Class which saves the data of the Doctor and Patient in their Object Reference and then these objects and added in a ArrayList to access later for the Old Enteries as well. Also it has a option for Discharge patient as well.
